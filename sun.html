        <h1>The Sun</h1>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal
        convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy
        for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is
        about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three
        quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of
        heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
        
          <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely
          accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6
          billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of
          this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The
          central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all
          stars form by this process.</p>
